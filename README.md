This project aim to retranslate (or at least, fix a lot of things) the game Shantae Half-Genie Hero on PC, known to have a very poor translation in european languages (French, German, Italian and Spanish).

Currently, this is a a project for the french retranslation, but since the game use a unique XML file with every languages in it, it could be nice to put all the retranslation in the same file.
You can download all XML that contains relevant text.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in retranslating the files in your language.
